Have you ever been curious on what opening an image in Notepad looked liked?
It's just incomprehensible garbage of Unicode fonts. You would be lucky if you found something there that formed a word or a link.
You should try it out and see for yourself what a .png looks like in Notepad. Maybe you'll find something cool.

When Cake originally made that drawing, he honestly didn't think about making a mod at all. "15% chance" if I remember correctly, I dunno.
