Have you ever been curious on what opening an image in Notepad looked liked?
It just incomprehensible garbage with maybe a few lines of text actually forming words, lol.
Try it out and see for yourself what a .png looks like in Notepad.

Since you're still here, let me tell you a fun fact about that that loading test image in "assets/images".
When Cake originally made that drawing, he honestly didn't think about making a mod at all. "15% chance" if I remember correctly, I dunno.
